SVG Logo Maker
Description
The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to generate custom logos with a choice of shapes, colors, and text. This tool is ideal for freelancers and developers who need quick, simple logos for their projects without the cost of a graphic designer.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from Node.js official website.




Text for Logo: Enter up to three characters to appear on the logo.
Text Color: Specify a color by name or hexadecimal value.
Shape: Choose from 'Circle', 'Triangle', or 'Square'.
Shape Color: Specify the color of the shape using a name or hexadecimal value.
Once all inputs are provided, the application will generate an SVG file named logo.svg in the current directory.

Example
Here's an example of the input you might enter and the output you can expect:

Text: SVG
Text Color: white
Shape: Circle
Shape Color: green
The resulting logo will feature a green circle with the text 'SVG' in white, centered within the circle.
